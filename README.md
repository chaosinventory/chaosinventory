# Chaosinventory

Chaosinventory is a hierarchical inventory system primarily focused on the needs of
event infrastructure.
It helps at planning and organizing items you have in stock, rent from others
or need for a particular event in future.

We try to run an 'api first' approach, so you can develop your own custom apps,
frontends and scripts to fit your needs while still using our backend.

We ship some kind of frontend now!
