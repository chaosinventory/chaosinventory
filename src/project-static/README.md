# Chaosinventory Frontend

Chaosinventory is a hierarchical inventory system primarily focused on the needs of event infrastructure. It helps at planning and organizing items you have in stock, rent from others or need for a particular event in future.

This is our official fancy stock frontend (TM), which you can use to manage your Chaosinventory.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You should have nodejs installed on your system. Information on how to install nodejs can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Installation

You can get the Chaosinventory frontend up and running by:

1. Cloning the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/chaosinventory/chaosinventory-frontend.git
   ```
2. Installing the dependencies
   ```
   cd chaosinventory-frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Running the frontend in developer mode
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Building

Chaosinventory can be built by executing the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will compile and bundle all required assets into a folder named `dist`, which contains all assets needed to serve the application over a web server or CDN.
